Our First Time

Don't it feel good babe
Don't it feel good baby
Cause it's so brand new babe
It's so brand new baby
Don't it feel good babe
Don't it feel good baby
Cause it's so brand new babe
It's so brand new baby
And now now here we are (here we are)
In this big old empty room
Staring at each other, who's gonna make the first move?
Been doing our thing for a minute
And now both our hearts are in it
The only place to go is all the way (ah, woo)
Is that alright?
Is that okay?
Girl, no need to be nervous
'Cause I got you all night
Don't you worry 'bout a thing (no no no)
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it,
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Clothes are not required for what we got planned
Ooh girl you're my desire, your wish is my command
Treat you like a princess, ooh girl you're so delicious
Like ice cream on a sunny day, gonna eat you before you melt away (babe)
Is that alright?
Is that okay?
Girl, no need to be nervous (no no no, no ooh)
Cause I (I've) got (got) you (you) all night
Don't you worry 'bout a thing (no no no)
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it,
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Don't it feel good babe
Don't it feel good baby
Cause it's so brand new babe
It's so brand new baby
Don't it feel good babe
Don't it feel good baby
Cause it's so brand new babe
It's so brand new baby
Ooh ooh baby!
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it,
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
