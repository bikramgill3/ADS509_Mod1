Runaway Baby

Ah, yes.
Well, looky here, looky here.
Ah, what do we have?
Another pretty thang ready for me to grab.
But little does she know
That I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
'Cause at the end of the night
It is her I'll be holding.
I love you so, hey.
That's what you'll say (that's what you'll say).
You'll tell me, "Baby, baby, please don't go away (don't go away)."
But when I play (but when I play),
I never stay (I never stay).
To every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say,
"Run, run, run away, run away, baby,
Before I put my spell on you.
You better get, get, get away, get away, darling,
'Cause everything you heard is true.
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rolling stone.
So, you better run, run, run away, run away, baby."
Well, let me think, let me think.
Ah, what should I do?
So many eager young bunnies
That I'd like to pursue.
Now even though they're eating out the palm of my hand,
There's only one carrot,
And they all gotta share it!
I love you so, hey.
That's what you'll say (that's what you'll say).
You'll tell me, "Baby, baby please don't go away (don't go away)."
But when I play (but when I play),
I never stay (I never stay).
To every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say,
"Run, run, run away, run away, baby,
Before I put my spell on you.
You better get, get, get away, get away, darling,
'Cause everything you heard is true.
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rolling stone.
So, you better run, run, run away, run away, baby."
Uh, check it out
See, I ain't tryna hurt you, baby.
No, no, no, I just wanna work you, baby.
Yup.Yup
See, I ain't tryna hurt you, baby.
No, no, no, I just wanna work you, baby.
If you're scared you better run (you better run),
You better run (you better run),
You better run (you better run),
You better—, you better—, you better—
Run, run, run away, run away, baby,
Before I put my spell on you.
You better get, get, get away, get away, darling,
'Cause everything you heard is true.
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rolling stone.
So you better run, run, run away, run away, baby.
