Somewhere In Brooklyn

She was covered in leather and gold
21 years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
Little Ms. Perfect
Sitting at the train stop
Red Nike high tops
Listening to hip-hop
While we were waiting
Started conversating
Before I got her name
Along came a train
Oh, oh
Next stop Brooklyn
Oh, oh,
Now I'm lookin'
She was covered in leather and gold
21 years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
On the street kicking rocks
Circling the same block
Greenpoint to Flatbush
Checking every corner shop
Tapping people's shoulders
Asking if they know her
Everyday's the same
It's back to the train
Oh, oh
Next stop Brooklyn
Oh, oh
I'm still looking
She was covered in leather and gold
21 years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I wonder will we ever meet again
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I wonder will we ever meet again
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I wonder if we'll ever meet again
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I hope we do somewhere in Brooklyn
